# Priority_Queue

Created a priority queue using a binary heap. This type of queue arranges elements based on their priority values. Elements with higher priority values are typically retrieved before elements with lower priority values.

Execution
  - clone repo to local workstation
  - either update the test_json.json file or create your own with a list of dictionaires containing commands and their priority levels
  - in a terminal window, go to the local repo's directory and run the following command
  	'python .\priority_queue.py -j <json_file>'

Time Complexity
  - insert(): O(log n)
  - remove(): O(log n)
  - peek(): O(1)
